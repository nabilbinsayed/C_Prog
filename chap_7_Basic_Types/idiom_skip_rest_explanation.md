### Question: 
 i'm using this portion: 

idiom: " while (getchar() != '\n')   /* skips rest of line */ 
  ;"

in the code: 

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  char ch;

  printf("enter a sentence: ");

  while (1) {
    scanf("%c", &ch);
    if (ch == ' ' || ch == '\n') {
      break;
    }
    printf("%c", ch);
  }

  while ((ch = getchar()) != '\n')
    ;

  putchar(ch);
  printf("bye\n");

  return 0;
}

What's special about this specific idiom? when I don't assign ch to getchar(), it just breaks at ' ' and doesn't read the rest of the line (i'm thinking as it prints out only a space in putchar(ch)). So what's even the point? The way I did it in the whole code, while((ch=getchar())!='\n'); seems to be more reasonable and assigns the new line character to ch, thus indicating the whole line has been read...? *

### Answer: 

Great observation! Let's dive deeper into what's happening with this idiom and why assigning `ch = getchar()` works differently than just calling `getchar()` in the idiom:

---

### **Behavior of `getchar()` in the Idiom**
The idiom:

```c
while (getchar() != '\n')
    ;
```

is used to skip all characters in the input buffer until a newline (`\n`) is encountered. It's a concise and idiomatic way to discard the rest of the current input line. 

- **Key Detail**: This idiom doesn't assign the value of `getchar()` to a variable like `ch`. As a result, you cannot use the last read character (the newline) after this loop. The function is purely used to "consume" the input, without retaining any of it.

---

### **Your Code with `ch = getchar()`**
When you use:

```c
while ((ch = getchar()) != '\n')
    ;
```

- **What's different?** The value returned by `getchar()` is assigned to `ch`, so after the loop ends, `ch` holds the last character that was read, which is the newline (`\n`).
- This makes sense if you want to explicitly know that the newline has been reached (or perform some action afterward).

---

### **Why It Fails Without `ch = getchar()`**
If you don't assign `ch` during this process (i.e., use `while (getchar() != '\n');`), the program doesn't know what `getchar()` read. In your code:

```c
putchar(ch);
```

`ch` will contain whatever value it had before the `getchar()` loop (in this case, a leftover value from earlier), which could be a space, a null character, or anything else. This is why you see unexpected behavior when using `putchar(ch)` afterward.

By using `ch = getchar()`, you're explicitly ensuring that `ch` has the value of the newline (`\n`) after the loop.

---

### **When to Use Each Version**
1. **`while (getchar() != '\n');`**  
   - Use this idiom when you don’t care about the specific characters being discarded and don’t need to use the newline character afterward. It’s efficient and concise.

2. **`while ((ch = getchar()) != '\n');`**  
   - Use this when you want to ensure `ch` holds the newline character at the end of the loop. This is helpful if you need to do something after confirming the newline (like printing it or validating that the input buffer is clean).

---

### **Simplified Version of Your Code**
Given your intention, here's a cleaner version of your code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  char ch;

  printf("Enter a sentence: ");

  // Read and print characters until space or newline
  while (1) {
    scanf("%c", &ch);
    if (ch == ' ' || ch == '\n') {
      break;
    }
    printf("%c", ch);
  }

  // Skip the rest of the input line
  while ((ch = getchar()) != '\n')
    ;

  // Print the newline character explicitly
  putchar(ch);
  printf("bye\n");

  return 0;
}
```

---

### **Key Points**
- If you want to discard the rest of the line and don't need to use the newline character afterward, use `while (getchar() != '\n');`.
- If you need to know when the newline is reached and potentially use it, assign `getchar()` to a variable (like `ch`).

In your case, assigning `ch = getchar()` is more reasonable because you're explicitly handling the newline (`\n`). If you have more questions or need clarification, feel free to ask!
