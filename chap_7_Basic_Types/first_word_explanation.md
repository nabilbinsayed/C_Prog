You're absolutely correct! The program could work fine without the portion that skips the remainder of the input line if the focus is just on printing the first word. However, the purpose of the `do-while` loop in this context is to explicitly handle the remainder of the line, ensuring there’s no leftover input that could interfere with subsequent operations (e.g., if additional input follows).

### **Why Include the `do-while` Loop?**
1. **Clean Input Buffer:**  
   Without the `do-while` loop, the rest of the line (after the first word) remains in the input buffer. If the program later attempts to read more input, it might process leftover data instead of waiting for fresh input.
   
2. **Explicit Intent:**  
   Including the `do-while` loop makes it clear that the program is intentionally discarding the rest of the line, which can improve readability and maintainability for complex programs.

### **Modified Program Without `do-while` Loop**
If you're only concerned with printing the first word and don't care about leftover input, the program can be simplified:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char ch;
    printf("Enter a line of text: ");
    
    // Read and print characters until a space or newline is encountered
    while (1) {
        scanf("%c", &ch);
        if (ch == ' ' || ch == '\n') {
            break; // Stop reading after the first word
        }
        printf("%c", ch); // Output the character
    }
    
    printf("\nProgram completed.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### **Output for the Same Input**
#### Input:
```
Enter a line of text: Hello World! This is a test.
```

#### Output:
```
Hello
Program completed.
```

### **Conclusion**
For simple use cases like this one, the `do-while` loop isn't strictly necessary. But if the program needs to handle additional input or ensure no leftover input affects subsequent operations, the loop becomes useful. It’s a good practice to clean up the input buffer when working with interactive input scenarios.
