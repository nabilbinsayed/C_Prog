Hereâ€™s a solution for the problem in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int item_number;
    float unit_price;
    char purchase_date[11]; // mm/dd/yyyy format needs 10 characters + 1 for null terminator

    // Input product information
    printf("Enter item number: ");
    scanf("%d", &item_number);
    printf("Enter unit price: ");
    scanf("%f", &unit_price);
    printf("Enter purchase date (mm/dd/yyyy): ");
    scanf("%s", purchase_date);

    // Print formatted output
    printf("\nItem\t\tUnit Price\tPurchase Date\n");
    printf("%-10d\t$%7.2f\t%s\n", item_number, unit_price, purchase_date);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `scanf` is used to read the item number, unit price, and purchase date.
   - The date is stored in a string (`char purchase_date[11]`) to accommodate the format `mm/dd/yyyy`.

2. **Formatted Output**:
   - The `%-10d` specifier ensures the item number is left-justified within 10 characters.
   - `$%7.2f` formats the unit price to 2 decimal places and right-justifies it within 7 characters (to account for prices up to `$9999.99`).
   - `%s` prints the purchase date as is.

3. **Tabs and Alignment**:
   - Tabs (`\t`) are used to align columns, and format specifiers handle justification.

### Example Output:

```
Enter item number: 583
Enter unit price: 13.5
Enter purchase date (mm/dd/yyyy): 10/24/2010

Item            Unit Price      Purchase Date
583             $  13.50        10/24/2010
```

#### I didn't exactly understand how you approached the problem of aligning the texts. What was your thought process while solving it? Where did you get those numbers? (field widths)


Great question! I'll break down my thought process in determining the field widths and formatting for aligning the output.

### Thought Process for Text Alignment

1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:
   - The item number and purchase date must be **left-justified**.
   - The unit price must be **right-justified**.
   - Use **tabs** (`\t`) and **field widths** for alignment.

2. **Design the Output Layout**:
   - Analyze the example table in the problem.
   - Identify the number of characters allocated for each column:
     - **Item Number**: Left-aligned with enough space for typical item numbers.
     - **Unit Price**: Needs enough room for a dollar sign, digits, decimal point, and two fractional digits.
     - **Purchase Date**: Has a fixed format (`mm/dd/yyyy`), which is always 10 characters long.

3. **Determine the Field Widths**:
   - **Item Number**:
     - Use a field width of 10. This means the item number will take up 10 spaces, aligning it with a clean left margin.
   - **Unit Price**:
     - It needs space for `$` and a price up to `9999.99` (7 characters including the decimal and fractional digits). We format it as `$%7.2f` to ensure right justification within a 7-character field.
   - **Purchase Date**:
     - The date format `mm/dd/yyyy` is always 10 characters, so no extra justification is needed.

4. **Use Tabs to Separate Columns**:
   - Tabs (`\t`) simplify spacing between columns. The alignment relies on field widths to ensure consistent appearance.

### Specific Numbers for Field Widths

#### Item Number (`%-10d`)
- **Reason for 10**: The example suggests the item number aligns neatly to the left but leaves room for other data on the same line. `%-10d` ensures the value is **left-justified** in a field 10 characters wide.

#### Unit Price (`$%7.2f`)
- **Reason for 7**: The unit price should be:
  - Right-justified to line up with the other prices in the column.
  - Have exactly **7 spaces** for:
    - `$` (1 character)
    - `9999` (4 digits max for dollars)
    - `.` (1 character)
    - `99` (2 digits for cents).
  - Using `%7.2f` ensures this, and the `$` is prepended manually in the format string.

#### Purchase Date (`%s`)
- **Reason for no field width**: The date is in the fixed format `mm/dd/yyyy`, which is exactly 10 characters. No justification or extra width is needed for alignment.

---

### Combining These Decisions

- Each value is placed in a separate column:
  - Item number: `%-10d\t` (left-aligned).
  - Unit price: `$%7.2f\t` (right-aligned).
  - Purchase date: `%s\n`.

- Tabs (`\t`) ensure proper separation of the columns.

---

### Example with Explanation of Alignment
Here's how the output is formatted:

```
Item            Unit Price      Purchase Date
583             $  13.50        10/24/2010
```

- The **item number (`583`)** starts at the left and occupies 10 spaces (left-aligned).
- The **unit price (`$ 13.50`)** is right-aligned in a 7-character field.
- The **purchase date (`10/24/2010`)** fits exactly, as it is always 10 characters.

---

### Field Widths and Justifications in Code

Hereâ€™s how it looks in the code:

```c
printf("%-10d\t$%7.2f\t%s\n", item_number, unit_price, purchase_date);
```

- **`%-10d`**: Left-align the item number within 10 spaces.
- **`$%7.2f`**: Format the unit price with 2 decimal places, right-aligned in 7 spaces.
- **`%s`**: Print the purchase date as is (10 characters wide).

---

### Key Takeaway
Aligning text involves:
1. **Deciding field widths** based on the maximum space needed for each column.
2. **Using format specifiers** (like `%-10d`, `%7.2f`) to justify text correctly.
3. **Using tabs** (`\t`) to separate columns while keeping the output clean.
