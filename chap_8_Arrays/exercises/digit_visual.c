// Calculators, watches, and other electronic devices often rely on seven-segment displays for numerical output. To form a digit, such devices “turn on” some of the seven segments while leaving others “off”:

//   _       _   _       _   _   _   _   _  
//  | |   |  _|  _| |_| |_  |_    | |_| |_| 
//  |_|   | |_   _|   |  _| |_|   | |_|  _| 

// Suppose that we want to set up an array that remembers which segments should be “on” for each digit. Let’s number the segments as follows:

//   0  
// 5   1
// 6   2
//   3  
//   4
  

// Here’s what the array might look like, with each row representing one digit:

// const int segments[10][7] = {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0}, ...};

// I’ve given you the first row of the initializer; fill in the rest.
