1. write a program to calculate the sum of the series as follow
b= base, n= power, sum=0
sample input:
b=1, n=5, sum=0
[ the series will look like: 5+6+6+6+6
sample output:
sum= 29

sample input:
b=4, n=3, sum=0
[ the series will look like: 3+7 +19
sample output:
sum= 29

sample input:
b=2, n=4, sum=0
[ the series will look like: 4+6 +8+12
sample output:
sum=30

sample input:
b=5, n=3, sum=0
[ the series will look like: 3+8 +28
sample output:
sum= 39
